# Welcome to the ARViS!

The goal of this repository is to help advance and disseminate automated injection technology to the neuroscience community. While the automated injection platform described here is not an off-the-shelf commercial solution, we have made efforts to make it as easy as possible for any neuroscience lab to build, use, and modify the platform.

The ARViS is designed to perform multiple injections onto the cortex of mice and non-human primates, but it can also be utilized for other animals and other regions in the brain. Some feature highlights are listed below.

# Feature Highlights
- ~50 Î¼m accuracy
- \>100 sequential injections
- 20 sec traveling time per site
- Flexible setting of injection regions
- 7 x 14 mm wide-field imaging

**Please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/nomurshin/ARViS_prepublication/wiki)!** We've provided comprehensive introduction to help you navigate each part of the platform there.

All scripts of the ARViS platform are written as MATLAB scripts, except for SA-UNet and Autostitch.
